<h3>       Hyderabad....</h3>
  <p>Hyderabad (Urban) District in its present shape has come into existence in August, 1978 consequent on formation of a new District, Ranga Reddy from the erstwhile Hyderabad District. All the rural areas of erst-while Hyderabad District have been included in Ranga Reddy District, while the area of Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad (excluding a small part), Secunderabad Cantonment, Lalaguda and Osmania University are included in Hyderabad District. There are 64 villages in the District and they are grouped into erstwhile talukas, Viz., Charminar, Golconda, Musheerabad and Secunderabad.</p>
  
  <p>Hyderabad is the capital of one of the most techno-savvy states in India, Telangana. The previous name of this city was Bagyanagaram. This city is also called the ‘city of pearls’ because of the major dealing of pearls that is done from this part of the state. Hyderabad was founded in 1591 and planned as a grid with the Charminar at its center. It has now grown well beyond the confines of the original walled city, to include a new town north of the Musi river, the Military Cantonment at Secunderabad, and a burgeoning high-tech Estate, nicknamed “Cyberabad”.
